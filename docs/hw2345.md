# Homework 2,3,4,5

Take a working system (written in LUA) and 
write it in any other language.

## A Small Task

The task is write some code to read a CSV file and generate summaries of columns (medians and standard
deviation for numerics; mode and entropy for symbolic columns).

eg. when run on our
[test file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timm/lua/main/data/auto93.csv),
this code reports:

```
xmid	{:Clndrs 4.0 :Model 76.0 :Volume 146.0 :origin 1.0}
xdiv	{:Clndrs 1.55 :Model 3.876 :Volume 100.775 :origin 0.775}
ymid	{:Acc+ 15.5 :Lbs- 2800.0 :Mpg+ 20.0}
ydiv	{:Acc+ 2.713 :Lbs- 887.209 :Mpg+ 7.752}
```

The task is very simple (lots of very small moving parts).
- The real goal here is to get your group to practice working together.
- You have five people in your group. Time to divide and conquer.

Note, write as much as you can from scratch. So, in Python, no Pandas or scikitlearn or argparse or optparse or their equivalent
in other languages.

- **HW2**: get this going for the `Num` and `Sym` class (below) and the tests cases
  `the`, `sym`, `num`, `bignum`.
- **HW3**: get this going for the `Cols`, `Row`, `Data` class and the test cases
  `eg.csv, eg.data, eg.stats`
- **HW4**: add all the bling from HW1. Also, add post-commit hooks to auto run all the test cases, the code
  coverage checks (if your language supports then), and the documentation generators.
  - For more on what kinds of documentation is acceptable,
    see [the web site from lecture1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29195/130997647-d933884e-8e5c-4f0c-a367-6a5d69bb1df1.png).
- **HW5**: for five other groups from cs510 (picked at random), apply the Project1 
  [rubric](https://github.com/txt/se22/blob/main/docs/proj1.md#rubric)
  - Important note: whatever scores you offer, these
    will **not** change the other group's scores.

## Where to submit:
- All submissions will be a repo url, posted to  Moodle.
- If you have outputs, or the text file with the rubrics 
  add them to e.g.  `out1.txt` in `/docs/out`.

## Resources

1. Example implementation: [source code](https://github.com/txt/se22/blob/main/etc/pdf/csv.pdf) 
2. [quick tutorial on LUA](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/).
3. [Sample input csv file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timm/lua/main/data/auto93.csv)

## First steps
1. Read the [quick tutorial on LUA](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/) (but you only have to read it, not write it)
   - Three ideas cover much of LUA
     - In LUA, names are global are default (unless marked with `local`).
       - Or, in the function header, you add extra variables.
     - LUA is a language with only one associative array data structure
       - If the keys are all consecutive integers, then these are simple lists (with indexes 1..n)
         - Contents are accessed via `list[1]`.
       - If the keys are symbols, then we use javascript/python style access:
         - Contents are accessed via `list.slotNiame`
     - LUA is a minimal "batteries not included" language.
      So the code given to you starts with a bunch of
      functions that are built-in to other languages.
2. Read the  [source code](https://github.com/txt/se22/blob/main/etc/pdf/csv.pdf). Written in LUA.
  **Your must not write in LUA.**. Note that:
  - Column1 of that pdf has a header string showing help, from which I build my `the` settings object.
  - Column2 of that pdf = some misc utils
  - Column3 of that pdf =  classes/methods.
  - Last column of that pdf = test cases for this system
  - Second last column of that pdf = shows code that exits to operating system with the number of test failures
    - No failures = return zero.
  - HINT: when reading strange source code:
    - FIRST look for the data structures (see column2)
    - SECOND look at the tests (last column)
    - THIRD look at the details.
3. Find some way to divide the functionality across may small files
- e.g. one file per class
- e.g. anything to do command-line options goes into its own file
- e.g. misc utilities into its own file.
- e.g. test cases in a separate file

## Theory
The  function _Y=F(X)_ computes dependent variables _Y_ from independent variables _X_. 
Some variables are `Num`eric (which we denote with a leading upper case letter) and some
are `Sym`bolic. Some `dependent` variables need to maximized (denoted with a trailing `-` sign)
and other need to be maximized (denoted with a trailing `+`).

We say a CSV file contains lots of `X,Y` examples. Line one of the file has a name showing the column
name and types. E.g. in our 
[test file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timm/lua/main/data/auto93.csv),
the dependent variables are columns 4,5 and 8. 

```
Clndrs,Volume,Hp:,Lbs-,Acc+,Model,origin,Mpg+
8,304.0,193,4732,18.5,70,1,10
8,360,215,4615,14,70,1,10
8,307,200,4376,15,70,1,10
8,318,210,4382,13.5,70,1,10
8,429,208,4633,11,72,1,10
```

Note also the ":" header on `Hp:` (above). This denotes a column to skip.

You have to report middle and diversity of each non-skipped column.

For numbers:
- mid = median = sort numbers seen so far, return the middle value
- div = standard deviation = sort numbers, find 90th, 10th percentile, return (90th-10th)/2.56
  - why? well you know that 1 or 2 standard deviations captures 66 to 95\% of the mass. So somewhere in-between
    1 and 2 is some point where you catch 90\% (that point is 1.28 standard deviations, so we used
    plus or minus 1.28=2.56)

For symbols:
- mid = mode = most common symbol
- div = entropy = for symbols occurring at probability p1,p2,... then   
     entropy= <em>&sum; -p<sub>i</sub> \* log2(p<sub>i</sub>)</em>.
  - Why? well, entropy can be viewed as  the effort required to recreate a signal. 
  - If a signal has parts
    that occur a probability p1,p2,... 
  - then the probability that we want to search for a signal is, wait for it,
    p1 + p2,.... 
  - And the effort to find the signal is _log2(p)_ (assuming a binary chop)
  - So the probability of needed that search effort is  <em>-p<sub>i</sub> \* log2(p<sub>i</sub>)</em>
    (and the minus sign is added as convention).

## Functionality

Your code must support the following (and outside of these bounds, feel free to **NOT** do things like csv):
- Five classes (or more): `Data`, `Cols`, `Sym`, `Num`, `Row`. For notes on these, see column2 of
  the  [source code](https://github.com/txt/se22/blob/main/etc/pdf/csv.pdf).
  - Note that `Num`s is a reservoir sampler;  
             i.e. it keeps N numbers and if you see more than N, 
             some old number is replaced at randaom. 
- A help string that can be displayed with `-h`.
- A `cli` function that can update  `the`, its slots from the command-line 
  - e.g. if `the` is `{name="Tim", age=20}` then `-n X` and `-a X` can update `name` and `age`.
- A `csv` function that reads each line of a text file, divides on some operator (e.g. comma),
  removes leading and trailing white space, then coerces the cells to ints, floats, booleans or
  (failing the rest) to strings.
- A set of demo tasks that can be called with `-e task` (and `-e ALL`) runs
  all tests.
  - The tests of 
    [source code](https://github.com/txt/se22/blob/main/etc/pdf/csv.pdf) (and perhaps your own, if you want).
  - On our system, `-e ALL` returns the following (but [YMMV[(https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/ymmv)).
    - The following output is in alphabetically ordering of the tests. A better ordering would be simpler to more complex.
      To see that ordering, look at the last column of
      the  [source code](https://github.com/txt/se22/blob/main/etc/pdf/csv.pdf).
    - Note that our tests can handle a crash (see "BAD"). To actually debug that one, you need the stack dump info
      that is hidden by the usual test output. So we have a

## Checklist

The task is done when we can see in your repo:

- Your repo shows a record of 5 people doing (approx) equal work.
- Something that can display a help string and where internal settings be updated from command-line.
- Something that can read csv files whose first line has ":+-" and upper and lower case in column names.
- Output like the above (and YMMV)
- For hw2, you need classes and methods for `Sym, Num`
- For hw2, you need to show output from `eg.the, eg.sym, eg,num, eg.bigbum`
- For hw3, you need classes and methods also for `Data, Cols, Row`
- For hw3, you need to should output from `eg.csv, eg.data, eg.stats`
- For hw3, test engine that can call one, or all, tests and which returns the number of failed tests to the operating system
  (so returning zerop means "no errors)
  - the test engine should be able to handle crashing tests (and keep running tests after the crash). For Python people,
    see `try:catch:`.
