Then one day, Bill Gates told them that enough was enough. Hence, Microsoft.

But the rebels disagreed. And their rebellion grew profitable.

There were wars

- "How much do we need to pay you to screw Netscape? This is your lucky day," Gates told executives of America Online Inc., according to an internal memo compiled by AOL.

The times changed:

- In 2014, Satya Nadella was named the new CEO of Microsoft. Microsoft began to adopt open source into its core business. In contrast to Ballmer's stance, Nadella presented a slide that read, "Microsoft loves Linux".[12] At the time of the acquisition of GitHub, Nadella said of Microsoft, "We are all in on open source."

Anyway, how to choose a license:

- see [https://choosealicense.com/licenses/](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/)

Feel free to roll your own, but beware "going off the reservation" (if you
pick a rare license, then your support will be rare too):

It is a factor predicting for project popularity:

- [Evaluation indicators for open-source software: a review](https://cybersecurity.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s42400-021-00084-8)
  Zhao, Y., Liang, R., Chen, X. et al.  Cybersecur 4, 20 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1186/s42400-021-00084-8

But other factors matter as well:
